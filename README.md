# Bayesian Inference Introduction

This repo is meant for purely educational purpose. It offers a series of notebooks explaining Bayesian Inference from the very basic cases, to more complex ones.

I decided to make this repo after finishing my thesis which was based around Bayesian inference, with which I initially struggled, and which I hope will help others.
